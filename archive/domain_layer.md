- This file is part of the Domain layer in Clean Architecture.
- Domain models are framework-agnostic - they don't depend on Android, Compose,
- or any external libraries. They represent pure business data.
-
- The Domain layer is the innermost layer and should have zero dependencies
- on other layers. This makes it highly reusable and testable.
